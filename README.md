Supporting code for manuscript: **"Insights into human gut virome by sampling a population from the Indian subcontinent".**

1. **Pre-processing of the sequencing data and metagenome assembly:** Raw reads were processed and assembled using the pipeline described in the manuscript.

2. **Identification of viral sequences:** Identification and taxonomic classification of viral contigs.

3. **crAssphage analysis:** Identifiaction of crAss-like phage, lifestyle prediction and taxonomic classification.

4. **Determination of species richness and their correlations:** Identify the viral and bacterial species richness in each sample.

5. **Functional profiles:** Identify the functional category of non-redundant viral contigs (> 1 kb) database from each sample.

6. **Determination of bacteriophage lifestyle:** Viral sequences were clustered into vOTUs and lytic or temperate lifecycle was identified.
